**Project Title:** House Sales Analysis in King County, USA

**Project Description:**
This project explores the factors influencing house prices in King County, USA, through data analysis and machine learning techniques. The dataset includes information on various attributes such as house size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and construction year. The primary objective is to identify key determinants affecting house prices and develop predictive models for price estimation.

The analysis involves several stages:
1. **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends, correlations, and distributions of features to gain insights into price variations.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Transforming and selecting relevant features for predictive modeling.
4. **Model Development:** Implementing regression models to predict house prices and evaluating their performance using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared.
